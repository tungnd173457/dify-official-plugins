By clicking on the `API Key Authorization Configuration` button, you can set following fields to use this plugin in your app.

- `Authorization Name`
  - The name of the authorization configuration, e.g. `Workspace A @ Dify Cloud`, `Workspace B @ Self-Hosted Dify`, etc.
- `Dify Knowledge API Base URL`
  - The base URL of the Dify Knowledge API, with trailing `/v1`.
  - For example, `https://api.dify.ai/v1` for Dify Cloud, or `http://api:5001/v1` for Docker-based self-hosted Dify.
- `Dify Knowledge API Key`
  - The API key for the Dify Knowledge API.

## 🛠️ Bundled Tools

### ✅ Get Full Doc

This is a tool to retrieve the full doc by concatenating all the chunks of the specified document in Knowledge.
With this tool, for example, you can force the LLM node to always refer to the entire content of a specific document, which is quite useful.

#### Parameters

- `knowledge_id`
  - The ID of the Knowledge to retrieve the uploaded file from.
  - You can find this ID in the URL of each Knowledge page (`/datasets/<knowledge_id>`).
- `document_id`
  - The ID of the document that contains the uploaded file.
  - You can find this ID in the URL of each document page (`/datasets/<knowledge_id>/documents/<document_id>`).
- `delimiter`
  - The string inserted between each chunk while joining them together.

#### Output Format

As `text` output variable, you can get the full doc of the specified document as a single (big, long) string by concatenating all of its chunks using the specified delimiter.

### ✅ Add File URL to Citations

⚠️ **USE WITH CAUTION** ⚠️

- **This tool does not work with Dify versions newer than 1.8.1.**
- **This is because the `/upload-file` endpoint of the Dify Knowledge API, which this tool relies on, has been removed ([see here](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/25543)).**
- **If a similar API is implemented again in the future, I'll update this tool, but I don't have an ETA.**

This is a tool to retrieve the download URLs for files included in the results of the Knowledge Retrieval node.
With this tool, you can provide the download URLs of the files in the workflow results.

#### Parameters

- `context`
  - The result of the Knowledge Retrieval node.
  - However, since Array[Object] cannot be selected directly here, please convert it to a string using a Template node or similar before inputting.
  - See the following section for details.
- `format`
  - The format of the output. See following section for details.

#### How to Input `context`

You can input the result of the Knowledge Retrieval node to the `context` parameter as follows:

- Connect new **Template** node to the Knowledge Retrieval node.
- Select `result` (`Array[Object]`) as the `arg1` of the **Template** node.
- Connect new **Add File URL to Citations** node to the **Template** node.
- Select `output` (`String`) of the **Template** node as the `context` of the **Add File URL to Citations** node.

#### Output Format

You can choose the output format:

- `full`
  - Returns a complete object with the metadata of the Knowledge Retrieval node results, adding a `download_url` field.
  - You can specify this as a context variable in the LLM node. For example, by using prompts such as, _"Please present the document you referred to with a download link using the URL in the `download_url` field"_, you can show users the actual document instead of just chunks.
  - However, due to technical limitations, if you specify this as a context variable in the LLM node, the chatbot's "Citations" feature will not work.
  - Additionally, depending on the accuracy of the LLM model, the URL may get rewritten during generation, resulting in invalid links.
- `minimal_json`
  - Returns a JSON string with basic information such as file names and download URLs of the referenced documents.
  - For instance, if you provide this JSON to the LLM along with the usual context and have it present download links when needed, you can generate download links while still utilizing the chatbot's Citations feature.
  - However, depending on the accuracy of the LLM model, the URL may get rewritten during generation, resulting in invalid links.
- `minimal_markdown`
  - Returns a list of Markdown formatted download links for the referenced documents.
  - By including this directly in the Answer node, you can completely prevent the issue of the URL being unintentionally altered by the LLM model and becoming unusable.
- `chunks_markdown`
  - Returns a collapsible Markdown that contains the referenced chunks and download links for the documents.
  - This can be used to replace the default Citations feature of the chatbot, by placing the output of this tool in the Answer node directly.

### ✅ Download File

⚠️ **USE WITH CAUTION** ⚠️

- **This tool does not work with Dify versions newer than 1.8.1.**
- **This is because the `/upload-file` endpoint of the Dify Knowledge API, which this tool relies on, has been removed ([see here](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/25543)).**
- **If a similar API is implemented again in the future, I'll update this tool, but I don't have an ETA.**

This is a tool to retrieve the uploaded file in Knowledge.  
With this tool, you can use Knowledge like a simple file server. This is useful when you want to retrieve specific files or their contents within your workflow and use them as templates, for example.

  - The ID of the Knowledge to retrieve the uploaded file from.
  - You can find this ID in the URL of each Knowledge page (`/datasets/<knowledge_id>`).
- `document_id`
  - The ID of the document that contains the uploaded file.
  - You can find this ID in the URL of each document page (`/datasets/<knowledge_id>/documents/<document_id>`).
- `format`
  - Format of the output. See following section for details.

#### Output Format

You can choose the output format of the file:

- `json`
  - As `text` output variable.
  - Raw response from the Knowledge API: `/datasets/{dataset_id}/documents/{document_id}/upload-file` (`GET`).
- `url`
  - As `text` output variable.
  - Download URL of the file.
- `link`
  - As `text` output variable.
  - Markdown download link of the file.
